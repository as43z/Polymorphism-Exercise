# POLYMORPHISM EXERCISE
This project is the repository for one of my DSA exercise about polymorphism.

It implements the simple functionalities seen in class:

- Abstract Figure Hereditary.
- Circle, Rectangle and Square figures.
- A sorting process.
- Total area of the array.

Also I added some other features such as:

- A rhombus (or diamond) figure.
- User input.
